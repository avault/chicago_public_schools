# Chicago Public Schools Analysis
An exploration of data centered around CPS.

To get started go to [this data set](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-School-Progress-Reports-SY1/cp7s-7gxg) and then click on Visualize -> Create Visualization.

From there spend some time (maybe 30 minutes) learning the interface.
Can you:
* Make a scatter plot?
* Make a histogram?
* Add appropriate axis labels to one of your plots?
* Come up with a sentence or two that describes what the main takeaway of one of the previous plots is?
* Save your plot?

Once you're familiar with the data set, scan this list of questions for one you would be interested in answering and may know the path forward for (or come up with your own):
* How well do selective enrollment schools succeed in enrolling their student into selective college in comparison to IB schools?
