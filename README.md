# Chicago Public Schools Analysis

The goal of this project is to explore data related to the Chicago Public School system, focusing on School Progress Reports. The end product of this project is a series of visualizations that answer a question or series of related questions.

To get started go to [this data set](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-School-Progress-Reports-SY1/cp7s-7gxg) and then click on Visualize -> Create Visualization.

From there spend some time (maybe 30 minutes) learning the interface.
Can you:
* Make a scatter plot?
* Make a histogram?
* Apply a filter onto your plot?
* Add appropriate axis labels to one of your plots?
* Come up with a sentence or two that describes what the main takeaway of one of the previous plots is?
* Save or publish your plot (this requires creating an account).

Once you're familiar with the data set, scan the below list of questions for one you would be interested in answering.
When you find a question you would like to answer, do the following:
* Look for the column(s) of data in the data set that would help answer your question.
* Choose the type of plot you would like to make. For example, if you are looking at a relationship between two different things consider a scatter plot.
* Create the visualization using the above methods.
* Consider if you need to filter the data in any way.
* Save
